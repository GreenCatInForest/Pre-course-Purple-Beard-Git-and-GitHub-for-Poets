That's quite weird:
To be a human.
To be a handful stardust.
Randon fluctuation of variables
Made us them who we are.
And we investigate the sky.
The sun. 
The wind. 
And fill them with a meanings. 
We give names to an animals.
We give names to Fhysical laws.
We create and investigate all what we can
At the small sphere moving around the Sun, 
looking like a jewelry bead, 
Which have been lost during playing by the laughing happy child.
